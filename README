step1-PCA:
In order to estiamte the volume of human, we propose a method that was used to estiamte volumes of livestocks.

The method includes two steps. In which, the first step is detecting the ground and eliminating the ground from the point cloud. We assume that the target, which corresponds to a livestock or a person in our work, was standing on the ground. Thus, if points of the ground were eliminated, the points lefted in the point cloud should correspond to the target.
